# TouchSwitch 
This project creates a touch-sensitive switch using a touch sensor module (TTP223). When a user touches the sensor, the module detects the touch and toggles the output state to turn a device ON or OFF. The project eliminates the need for complex integrated circuit design and demonstrates the simplicity and efficiency of using touch sensor modules for switch applications.
